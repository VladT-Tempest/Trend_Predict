# Trend_Predict
 Predict Trends with Python and ML

- Installing necessary modules: The tutorial begins with installing required Python modules, including yFinance for fetching historical stock data and Neural Prophet for building the predictive model.

- Data preprocessing: After importing the necessary modules, the tutorial demonstrates how to fetch and preprocess stock data using pandas. It includes extracting relevant columns, converting date formats, and renaming columns for input and output labels (DS and y).

- Model training: The tutorial proceeds with training the Neural Prophet model using the prepared stock data. It involves fitting the model to the data set.

- Making predictions: Once the model is trained, predictions are generated for future stock prices using a specified number of days. The predictions are visualized alongside the original data to evaluate the model's performance.

- Visualizing model components: Finally, the tutorial illustrates how to visualize various components of the model, such as trend, yearly seasonality, and weekly seasonality, for a comprehensive understanding of the predicted trends.
